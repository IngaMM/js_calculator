Instructions

1. Save index.html, myStyle.css & myScript.js in one folder.

Discussion
I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Create a calculator with buttons and a display that can perform the following
operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Include an equal button and a clear button.
Users should be able to string together several operations.
Long decimals should be rounded so that the display does not overfloat.

Bonuses
Users should be able to enter floating point numbers.
The calculator should have a "nice" appearance.
Add a backspace button so that wrong numbers that the user has entered can be
deleted.
Add keyboard support.
